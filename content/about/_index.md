Hi, I'm Nimitha

Working in IT for over 13 years, converging business and consumer goals when collaborating on new projects. Throughout my career, I've gained incredible experience working on large-scale, high- profile initiatives.

I've had diverse roles such as senior project manager, product manager and digital marketing consultant â€“ gratefully giving me a unique perspective on how to solve varied and complex business challenges. I've also had the good fortune to work with many wonderful organizations such as Accenture, Capgemini and Deloitte.
